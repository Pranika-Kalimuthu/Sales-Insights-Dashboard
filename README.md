# **Sales Insights Dashboard**  

This project showcases my ability to analyze and visualize sales data using **SQL** and **Power BI**. Using the **AdventureWorksDW** database, I extracted data from tables like `dim_customers`, `dim_date`, and `fact_internet_sales`, transformed it, and built an interactive dashboard to uncover actionable insights.  

## **Key Objectives**  
- Analyze sales trends and regional performance.  
- Identify top-performing products and underperforming areas.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations to boost sales and customer satisfaction.  

## **Skills Demonstrated**  
- **SQL**: Wrote queries to extract and transform data, saving results as views.  
- **Power BI**: Created calculated columns, measures, and interactive visualizations.  
- **Data Modeling**: Built a star schema with one fact table and five dimension tables.  

## **Findings**  
- Sales grew consistently, especially in 2022.  
- North America contributed **38.7%** of total sales.  
- Bikes generated **95.4%** of revenue, while accessories had high order volume but lower revenue.  

## **Recommendations**  
- Introduce bundled discounts for accessories and clothing.  
- Analyze customer feedback to improve products and services.  
- Partner with local organizations to promote bike riding.
